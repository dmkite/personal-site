        </div>
        <div class="desc">
          <p>Thousands of youth and teens are woefully unaware of how to stay safe online. Typical cyber safety education is ineffective; students don't need someone to come in and tell them to stop using social media. They need autonomy, they need empowerment and they need free, engaging, and relevant cyber safety education.</p>

          <h4>What I did</h4>
          <div class="valign"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
          <p>I spearheaded a complete reimagination of the education process. Teaching myself the CSS and HTML Skills needed to develop Digital Decisions: a digital choose your own adventure. This allowed young adults to safely explore the realities of a digitally connected life and learning about real world resources to solve the challenges that can arise.</p>

          <h4>The Impact</h4>
          <div class="valign"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
          <p>Hundreds of students have gained agency over their education, consistently reporting a better understanding of expectations, consequences, and resources. Students on average rate the Digital Decisions module  as 20% more engaging  than typical presentations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="desc">
          <p>Funding for creative development in public schools is being diminished nation-wide. Creative camps, after-school studio time - even art supplies - can be really expensive. The opportunity to explore passions, to learn new skills, and to become a creator shouldn't belong solely to the wealthy.</p>

          <h4>What I did</h4>
          <div class="valign"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
          <p>I teamed up with local artists to develop a program where students from under-resourced homes could nurture their creative spirits. Heavy on socio-emotional learning, students were encouraged to adopt a growth mind-set and express themselves in healthy generative ways.</p>

        <div class="desc">
          <p>Through my work with FLY, dozens of Ypsi kids with no place to go after school became a part of a rich design community and experienced premium art education - learning about artistry as a profession, exploring the design thinking process through lessons heavily influenced by Stanford School of Design curriculum, and creating portfolios of work.</p>

          <p>I worked with eight-year-olds and eighty-year-olds, getting access to resources for life-long Michiganders and sharing meals with folks brand new to the United States. In between I facilitated two after school programs, directed an educational summer camp, and forged authentic relationships with dozens of people; each with wildly different stories from my own.</p>

          <p>I leading a team of educators and volunteers, 45 elementary age students grew social-emotional skills, learned about nutrition, and finished their homework every day. Further, 30 families got the safety resources their kids needed. Citizens of Washtenaw County no longer went hungry due to the dozens of food distributions I facilitated.</p>
